# Privacy Policy.

[Japanese](ja.md) / [English](en.md)

# Introduction

yuki0311 ("we", "us", "our") has established the following privacy policy regarding the handling of users' personal information in the services provided on various devices for smartphones and mobile devices (the "Services").
In the event of any inconsistency between this Privacy Policy in Japanese and the corresponding Privacy Policy in other languages, the Japanese version shall prevail.

## Data to be collected

We do not collect any information that users provide directly through the Service's content or the Service's functionality. All data entered by you through the Services will only be stored on your device. However, the Service uses third party services that may collect personal information or information that can be used to identify you.

The third party services used by the Service and links to their privacy-related information are listed below.

- [vrchat.com](https://hello.vrchat.com/privacy)
- [github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies)

## Further information on personal data

The Service is not intended for children under 13 years of age. The user declares that he/she is an adult according to the applicable law. Minors may only use the Services with the support of a parent or guardian. Under no circumstances may persons under the age of 13 use the Services.

## Links to other sites

The Service may contain links to other sites. When you click on a third party link, you will be taken to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. We therefore strongly recommend that you review the privacy policies of these websites. We have no control over, and accept no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Changes to our privacy policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. The Privacy Policy is maintained on Github and we will notify you of changes when we post a new Privacy Policy on this page by enabling Notifications on Github. These changes will take effect immediately after they are posted on this page. More information about notifications can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications).

## Transparency of the Service

All programmes of the Service are publicly available on Github.
